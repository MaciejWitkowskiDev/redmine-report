# redmine-report

## Redmine daily, weekly and monthly e-mail reports

This script sends daily, weekly and monthly e-mail reports from Redmine.
It formats them nicely into html and sends a pretty HTML e-mail with a table.

It pulls data directly from the Redmine database using SQL.

It should be configured on the server running redmine using cronjobs.
Unfortunately, I don't have a setup script ready, maybe it will be improved in the future.

The script was used in the past for inside usage in a company, so it's not well documented or entirely finished. 
Use at your own risk.
